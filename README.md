The secret to making the perfect fried egg is to add a bit of water into the pan and then cover it with a lid. 
The water will evaporate but the steam will stay inside the pan, that way you fix the gooey stuff that normally sticks to the top of the egg without it getting over cooked! Pretty cool right.
